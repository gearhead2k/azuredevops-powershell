# azuredevops-powershell
This is a repository for a PowerShell scripts to help manage Azure DevOps. This is just my personal repo for helpfull scripts. More checks and work could/should be done for more general use.

## Starting out
Before using copy the connection-config-sample.json to connection-config.json and fill in the values. This will allow you to centrally manage the config.
